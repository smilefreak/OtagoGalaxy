Thanks for using the galaxy clustering interface.

The module enables the use of a custom xml file to specify 
grids that are avaliable to galaxy.

A possible usecase for this module is a 
galaxy local server with limited requirements

local job runner.
pbs cluster 
and a drmaa cluster.

The ability for the galaxy user to be able 
to select where the jobs get run.

Also added splitting functionality to enable the user to 
split files by megabase pairs and other such constructs.
