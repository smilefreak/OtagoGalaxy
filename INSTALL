Otago Galaxy Comes Packaged with 3 major Components
that can all be installed seperately or together.

Galaxy-Tools

to be set to your local galaxy install location.


Many of our tools use external dependencies not installed
with our installer.

These are listed below
    -Impute2
    -vcftools
    -tabix


If you already have some of you own custom tools installed 
and do not want to overwrite you tool_conf.xml file pass the argument
-n and no tools will be overwritten.

To add the tools to you install then just copy the Otago sections to your
tool_conf.xml. tool_conf.xml is located in the scripts folder.

This command will install the xgrid module to your local
galaxy instance. THe GALAXY_HOME_FOLDER environment variable needs
